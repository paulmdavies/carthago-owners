Great Chinese food and you could go up as many times as you wished.  With full tummies we headed for the bus station where we joined the coach for a journey back to the campsite briefly stopping to view Cranwell RAF College.  Throughout the coach journeys Dave Davies gave us a running commentary about the points of interest of his home area."),

The runners up also received a bottle of wine between two. The wine for the quiz prizes was kindly donated by Lowdhams. The Woodland Waters management also offered everyone a complimentary drink. Many new friends were made and promises of meeting up again at our next Gathering."),
